			In current situation if any citizen wants to give complaint against any 
			crime they should go for manually and police department also has to 
			investigate the case and they should maintain the reports manually. 
			If the crime case is investigating in two different areas then mutual 
			sharing of reports are not possible at the same time sending complaints 
			in online also not possible to avoid this problem we are introducing a 
			new concept called “My Mission with out Crime”.

	<h1 style="color: white;">Proposed System:</h1>
	<p>
		<font color="white">
			The proposed system applies to Police Institutions all across the country 
			and specifically looks into the subject of Crime Records Management. 
			It is well understood that Crime Prevention, Detection and Conviction of 
			criminals depend on a highly responsive backbone of Information Management.
			 It is proposed to centralize Information Management in Crime for the 
			 purposes of fast and efficient sharing of critical information across 
			 all Police Stations across the territory. Initially, the system will be 
			 implemented across Cities and Towns and later on, be interlinked so that 
			 a Police detective can access information across all records in the 
			 state thus helping speedy and successful completion to cases. 
			 The System would also be used to generate information for pro-active 
			 and preventive measures for fighting crime. This application gives the 
			 following information.
